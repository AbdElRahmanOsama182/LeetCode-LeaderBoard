3. Navigate to the backend folder, install dependencies and run the server:
    ```sh

## How It Works

Our project utilizes Vite React for the frontend and Express for the backend server, both hosted on Vercel. The application fetches real-time user statistics from the LeetCode GraphQL API `https://leetcode.com/graphql/` to ensure up-to-date leaderboard rankings.
